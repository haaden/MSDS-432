It starts with the first employee--once that employee reaches 8 hours for the day, then it changes the shift to the next employee. The first slot starts on Monday at 0:00 hrs and day changes when 24 hours is filled by the employee time slots. The algorithm is greedy because it fills up the first guard until he or she hits the overtime cut-off hour because it increases the average cost per hour. The above table shows that each employee is given a maximum shift of 8 hours and because there are 7 days and 6 employees, the first three employees get the additional Sunday shift. \n",
